            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>Throughout my academic journey at Hunter College, I immersed myself in various subjects such as data structures, algorithms, computer architecture, and big data technology, which laid a robust foundation for my career in software engineering.</p>
            <p>I had the opportunity to intern at American Express twice, where I began to pick up skills in software development and data security. During my first internship, I collaborated with a team to work on a functional GraphQL model demonstrating authentication and authorization principles, which was successfully presented to company leaders and stakeholders. My second internship involved working on a much larger team to help refurbish the American Express partner portal, focusing on code implementation, validations, and security checks.</p>
            <p>Beyond my professional experiences, I am deeply committed to community service. As a volunteer and Communications Assistant for Forging Opportunities for Refugees in America (FORA), I tutored refugee children in English and mathematics, authored awareness articles, and contributed over 180 hours of dedicated service, earning the Silver Presidential Service Award.</p>
            <p>My technical skills include a diverse range of programming languages such as Python, C++, SQL, and JavaScript, along with proficiency in web development using HTML and CSS. I am adept at using frameworks like React and Node.js, and tools like Git, Docker, and Visual Studio Code.</p>
            <p>In my projects, I've developed a VR application using Unity and a CLI-based social media application in C++, demonstrating my ability to create innovative solutions. Additionally, my work with big data technologies, including PySpark and MongoDB, showcases my capability to handle and analyze large datasets effectively.</p>
            <p>I am passionate about leveraging technology to solve real-world problems and am always eager to learn and take on new challenges. Thank you for visiting my website!</p>
